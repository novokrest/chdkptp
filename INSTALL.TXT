Binaries fro some platforms are available from the assembla files area
https://www.assembla.com/spaces/chdkptp/documents

There is no installer, just unzip the file wherever you want.

h2. Windows

* You must install a libusb driver to connect to cameras. Instructions are
  available on the CHDK wiki at
  http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/PTP_Extension#LibUSB_Driver_for_Windows
* After the driver is configured, simply run the executable. If you double
  click on the .exe, the gui will start. If you want to start from the command
  line, simply run chdkptp -i

h2. Linux

If a binary for your particular flavor of Linux is not available, you must build
from source. Some instructions can be found in README.TXT

h3. Environment

To allow chdkptp to locate it's Lua files and libraries, it is necessary to set
some environment variables. chdkptp-sample.sh in the zip provides an example.
* set CHDKPTP_DIR to the path where you unzipped the files (the directory
  containing the chdkptp binary)
* If you are using a GUI build and the IUP and CD libraries are not on your
  default LD_LIBRARY_PATH, add them to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
* The raspberry pi packages include the GUI libraries, so LD_LIBRARY_PATH can
  be set as follows LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CHDKPTP_DIR/libs/cd:$CHDKPTP_DIR/libs/iup

h3. Interactions with default software 

On Linux, default camera software may connect to the camera automatically. The
details will depend on the Linux distribution and configuration. Some
discussion can be found at:

h3. Permissions issues

In some configurations, the camera will only be accessible to the root user by
default. Some discussion can be found at:
